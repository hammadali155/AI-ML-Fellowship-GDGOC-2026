# AI vs ML vs DL vs DS

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The broad concept of creating smart machines capable of mimicking human intelligence.
*   **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
*   **Deep Learning (DL)**: A specialized subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to solve complex problems like image recognition.
*   **Data Science (DS)**: An interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data.

While AI, ML, and DL focus on building intelligent systems, DS encompasses the entire process of data analysis, often utilizing these technologies as tools to derive value.
